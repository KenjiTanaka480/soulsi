       <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Last updated: 6 December 2024</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how SoulSi ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use the SoulSi application software, website, or related services ("App").</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SoulSi APP, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE APP.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information collected via the SoulSi App. "Personal information" refers to data that identifies you personally, either alone or combined with other information. Non-personal or aggregate data, which cannot identify an individual, is not subject to the same restrictions.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect and process minimal data to deliver the SoulSi service effectively:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User-Generated Content: Data such as voice inputs, text prompts, and user-uploaded media, which are processed by SoulSi’s AI systems to generate responses and other outputs. Content may be stored temporarily for processing but is deletable upon user request.</li>
  <li>Communication Data: Contact information (e.g., email addresses) voluntarily provided through support requests or account creation.</li>
  <li>Device Data: Technical details, such as device type, operating system, and usage statistics, are collected to improve functionality and troubleshoot issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Payment Processing</h2>

<p>Payments are handled through third-party providers, such as app stores or payment gateways, depending on the platform. We do not collect or store payment information directly.</p>

<h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>Your information is used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and improve the App’s features.</li>
  <li>Respond to support requests and inquiries.</li>
  <li>Ensure compliance with legal and security obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell your data to third parties or use it for purposes unrelated to delivering the App’s services.</p>

<h2>5. User Rights</h2>

<p>Users may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access: Request details about the data we collect about you.</li>
  <li>Correct: Update inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
  <li>Delete: Request the deletion of your user-generated content or account data.</li>
  <li>Restrict Processing: Limit the ways in which we use your data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests should be submitted to <a href="mailto:support@soulsi.com">support@soulsi.com</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Copyright and User Responsibility</h2>

<p>Users are responsible for ensuring that any content uploaded to SoulSi does not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. SoulSi does not claim ownership of your content but requires rights to process and store it as needed to provide services.</p>

<h2>7. Security Measures</h2>

<p>We prioritize data security through industry-standard measures, including encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and restricted access to sensitive data. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

<p>User data, including generated outputs and communication logs, is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill service requirements or as required by law. Users may request the deletion of their data by contacting <a href="mailto:support@soulsi.com">support@soulsi.com</a>.</p>

<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>SoulSi’s services may involve international data transfers. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection laws by implementing adequate safeguards for these transfers.</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>SoulSi integrates with third-party providers, such as cloud storage and AI processing systems, to deliver its services. These providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data.</p>

<h2>11. Minors</h2>

<p>If you reside in the EU or another jurisdiction with specific age restrictions, you confirm that you meet the minimum age required to use the App. Parents or guardians may contact us to review or delete data associated with their child’s account.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Substantial changes will be communicated to users through the App or email notifications.</p>

<h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
